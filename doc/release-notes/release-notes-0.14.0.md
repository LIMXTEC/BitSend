BitSend 0.14.0 Release notes
==========================

This is a new major version release, bringing both new features and
bug fixes.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:
<https://github.com/LIMXTEC/BitSend/issues>

Upgrading 
=========================
If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/bitsend-Qt (on Mac) or
bitsendd/bitsend-qt (on Linux).

Notable changes
===============
Segregated witness soft fork
----------------------------

Segregated witness (segwit) is a soft fork that, if activated, will
allow transaction-producing software to separate (segregate) transaction
signatures (witnesses) from the part of the data in a transaction that is
covered by the txid. This provides several immediate benefits:

- **Elimination of unwanted transaction malleability:** Segregating the witness
  allows both existing and upgraded software to calculate the transaction
  identifier (txid) of transactions without referencing the witness, which can
  sometimes be changed by third-parties (such as miners) or by co-signers in a
  multisig spend. This solves all known cases of unwanted transaction
  malleability, which is a problem that makes programming Bitcoin wallet
  software more difficult and which seriously complicates the design of smart
  contracts for Bitcoin.

- **Capacity increase:** Segwit transactions contain new fields that are not
  part of the data currently used to calculate the size of a block, which
  allows a block containing segwit transactions to hold more data than allowed
  by the current maximum block size. Estimates based on the transactions
  currently found in blocks indicate that if all wallets switch to using
  segwit, the network will be able to support about 70% more transactions. The
  network will also be able to support more of the advanced-style payments
  (such as multisig) than it can support now because of the different weighting
  given to different parts of a transaction after segwit activates (see the
  following section for details).

- **Weighting data based on how it affects node performance:** Some parts of
  each Bitcoin block need to be stored by nodes in order to validate future
  blocks; other parts of a block can be immediately forgotten (pruned) or used
  only for helping other nodes sync their copy of the block chain.  One large
  part of the immediately prunable data are transaction signatures (witnesses),
  and segwit makes it possible to give a different "weight" to segregated
  witnesses to correspond with the lower demands they place on node resources.
  Specifically, each byte of a segregated witness is given a weight of 1, each
  other byte in a block is given a weight of 4, and the maximum allowed weight
  of a block is 4 million.  Weighting the data this way better aligns the most
  profitable strategy for creating blocks with the long-term costs of block
  validation.

- **Signature covers value:** A simple improvement in the way signatures are
  generated in segwit simplifies the design of secure signature generators
  (such as hardware wallets), reduces the amount of data the signature
  generator needs to download, and allows the signature generator to operate
  more quickly.  This is made possible by having the generator sign the amount
  of bitcoins they think they are spending, and by having full nodes refuse to
  accept those signatures unless the amount of bitcoins being spent is exactly
  the same as was signed.  For non-segwit transactions, wallets instead had to
  download the complete previous transactions being spent for every payment
  they made, which could be a slow operation on hardware wallets and in other
  situations where bandwidth or computation speed was constrained.

- **Linear scaling of sighash operations:** In 2015 a block was produced that
  required about 25 seconds to validate on modern hardware because of the way
  transaction signature hashes are performed.  Other similar blocks, or blocks
  that could take even longer to validate, can still be produced today.  The
  problem that caused this can't be fixed in a soft fork without unwanted
  side-effects, but transactions that opt-in to using segwit will now use a
  different signature method that doesn't suffer from this problem and doesn't
  have any unwanted side-effects.

- **Increased security for multisig:** Bitcoin addresses (both P2PKH addresses
  that start with a '1' and P2SH addresses that start with a '3') use a hash
  function known as RIPEMD-160.  For P2PKH addresses, this provides about 160
  bits of security---which is beyond what cryptographers believe can be broken
  today.  But because P2SH is more flexible, only about 80 bits of security is
  provided per address. Although 80 bits is very strong security, it is within
  the realm of possibility that it can be broken by a powerful adversary.
  Segwit allows advanced transactions to use the SHA256 hash function instead,
  which provides about 128 bits of security  (that is 281 trillion times as
  much security as 80 bits and is equivalent to the maximum bits of security
  believed to be provided by Bitcoin's choice of parameters for its Elliptic
  Curve Digital Security Algorithm [ECDSA].)

- **More efficient almost-full-node security** Satoshi Nakamoto's original
  Bitcoin paper describes a method for allowing newly-started full nodes to
  skip downloading and validating some data from historic blocks that are
  protected by large amounts of proof of work.  Unfortunately, Nakamoto's
  method can't guarantee that a newly-started node using this method will
  produce an accurate copy of Bitcoin's current ledger (called the UTXO set),
  making the node vulnerable to falling out of consensus with other nodes.
  Although the problems with Nakamoto's method can't be fixed in a soft fork,
  Segwit accomplishes something similar to his original proposal: it makes it
  possible for a node to optionally skip downloading some blockchain data
  (specifically, the segregated witnesses) while still ensuring that the node
  can build an accurate copy of the UTXO set for the block chain with the most
  proof of work.  Segwit enables this capability at the consensus layer, but
  note that Bitcoin Core does not provide an option to use this capability as
  of this 0.13.1 release.

- **Script versioning:** Segwit makes it easy for future soft forks to allow
  Bitcoin users to individually opt-in to almost any change in the Bitcoin
  Script language when those users receive new transactions.  Features
  currently being researched by Bitcoin Core contributors that may use this
  capability include support for Schnorr signatures, which can improve the
  privacy and efficiency of multisig transactions (or transactions with
  multiple inputs), and Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), which can
  improve the privacy and efficiency of scripts with two or more conditions.
  Other Bitcoin community members are studying several other improvements
  that can be made using script versioning.
  

InstantTX and DarkSend Removal
----------------------------
Moving forward, we've dropped support for both InstantTX and DarkSend. With the SegWit upgrade these features are going to be superseeded by far superior technology. SegWit will enable the BitSend to adopt the Lightning Network (https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf), cross-chain atomic swaps, advanced versions of TumbleBit (https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf) and more.


Performance Improvements
--------------

Validation speed and network propagation performance have been greatly
improved, leading to much shorter sync and initial block download times.

- The script signature cache has been reimplemented as a "cuckoo cache",
  allowing for more signatures to be cached and faster lookups.
- Assumed-valid blocks have been introduced which allows script validation to
  be skipped for ancestors of known-good blocks, without changing the security
  model. See below for more details.
- In some cases, compact blocks are now relayed before being fully validated as
  per BIP152.
- P2P networking has been refactored with a focus on concurrency and
  throughput. Network operations are no longer bottlenecked by validation. As a
  result, block fetching is several times faster than previous releases in many
  cases.
- The UTXO cache now claims unused mempool memory. This speeds up initial block
  download as UTXO lookups are a major bottleneck there, and there is no use for
  the mempool at that stage.
  
  
Hierarchical Deterministic Key Generation
-----------------------------------------
Newly created wallets will use hierarchical deterministic key generation
according to BIP32 (keypath m/0'/0'/k').
Existing wallets will still use traditional key generation.

Backups of HD wallets, regardless of when they have been created, can
therefore be used to re-generate all possible private keys, even the
ones which haven't already been generated during the time of the backup.
**Attention:** Encrypting the wallet will create a new seed which requires
a new backup!

Wallet dumps (created using the `dumpwallet` RPC) will contain the deterministic
seed. This is expected to allow future versions to import the seed and all
associated funds, but this is not yet implemented.

HD key generation for new wallets can be disabled by `-usehd=0`. Keep in
mind that this flag only has affect on newly created wallets.
You can't disable HD key generation once you have created a HD wallet.

There is no distinction between internal (change) and external keys.

HD wallets are incompatible with older versions of Bitcoin Core.

Signature validation using libsecp256k1
---------------------------------------

ECDSA signatures inside Bitcoin transactions now use validation using
[libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) instead of OpenSSL.

Depending on the platform, this means a significant speedup for raw signature
validation speed. The advantage is largest on x86_64, where validation is over
five times faster. In practice, this translates to a raw reindexing and new
block validation times that are less than half of what it was before.

Libsecp256k1 has undergone very extensive testing and validation.

A side effect of this change is that libconsensus no longer depends on OpenSSL.

Reduce upload traffic
---------------------

A major part of the outbound traffic is caused by serving historic blocks to
other nodes in initial block download state.

It is now possible to reduce the total upload traffic via the `-maxuploadtarget`
parameter. This is *not* a hard limit but a threshold to minimize the outbound
traffic. When the limit is about to be reached, the uploaded data is cut by not
serving historic blocks (blocks older than one week).
Moreover, any SPV peer is disconnected when they request a filtered block.

This option can be specified in MiB per day and is turned off by default
(`-maxuploadtarget=0`).
The recommended minimum is 144 * MAX_BLOCK_SIZE (currently 144MB) per day.

Whitelisted peers will never be disconnected, although their traffic counts for
calculating the target.

A more detailed documentation about keeping traffic low can be found in
[/doc/reduce-traffic.md](/doc/reduce-traffic.md).


Direct headers announcement (BIP 130)
-------------------------------------

Between compatible peers, [BIP 130]
(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0130.mediawiki)
direct headers announcement is used. This means that blocks are advertised by
announcing their headers directly, instead of just announcing the hash. In a
reorganization, all new headers are sent, instead of just the new tip. This
can often prevent an extra roundtrip before the actual block is downloaded.


Wallet: Pruning
---------------

With 0.12 it is possible to use wallet functionality in pruned mode.
This can reduce the disk usage from currently around 60 GB to
around 2 GB.

However, rescans as well as the RPCs `importwallet`, `importaddress`,
`importprivkey` are disabled.

To enable block pruning set `prune=<N>` on the command line or in
`bitsend.conf`, where `N` is the number of MiB to allot for
raw block & undo data.

A value of 0 disables pruning. The minimal value above 0 is 550. Your
wallet is as secure with high values as it is with low ones. Higher
values merely ensure that your node will not shut down upon blockchain
reorganizations of more than 2 days - which are unlikely to happen in
practice. In future releases, a higher value may also help the network
as a whole: stored blocks could be served to other nodes.

For further information about pruning, you may also consult the [release
notes of v0.11.0](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.11.0/doc/release-notes.md#block-file-pruning).
